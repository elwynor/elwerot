 WHAT IS EROTICA?

 Erotica is the first adult fantasy adventure/RPG game for Worldgroup. The 
 object of the game is simple, to have sexual encounters with as many people as
 possible. The more sexual encounters you have, the higher your score will be. 
 And for the sake of your ego, you are going to want to be on the top 10 
 listing!  Erotica is a multi-player game. 
 
 GAMEPLAY
 
 This game is unlike most other games in the respect then even when you
 quit playing the game, your character will still remain in the game to be
 used/abused by other players. So it is in your best interests to play this
 game twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, three hundred sixty-five
 days a year.

 But if you can't, rest assured that once someone else has sucessfully
 seduced you, you will be "recovering from a prior encounter" the next time
 a player tries to seduce you, or until you re-enter the game or the next
 day, which ever comes first.

 To have a sexual encounter with another person you must attempt to "arouse"
 the other player. For example, if you were attempting to arouse a player by
 the name of Alyssa, you would type "arouse Alyssa" (without the quotes).

 If you are sexually compatible with the other player, the encounter will be
 allowed to continue, else you'll get rejected. Once the encounter is started
 you will get a menu listing the "toys" that you currently have in your
 posession. You will have to use your items on the other player to reduce
 their defenses.

 Once the other player submits to you, you will then be given a few different
 choices on the type of sexual encounter you want to have with the other
 player.
 
 COMMANDS
 
 Erotica is similar to other text adventure/RPG/MUD games. To move around you
 will need to type in the direction you want to move. For example, if you want
 to go north you can type: N, North, or Go North.
 
 You are also allowed to interact with other players in the game. If you wish
 to say something, all you need to do is type:
 
     say Hi People, hows it going?
 
 And everyone else in the same room would see your message.
 
 You can also do actions to other players, such as:
 
    hug  [player name]   <--- Cause you to hug the other player
    kiss [player name]   <--- Cause you to kiss the other player
 
 The list of actions include kick, hum, answer, cry, and many more. You can
 type "help list" in the game to get an expanded list of these actions.

 Your computer will relay you the information about the world of Erotica.
 It will tell you what is happening around you, what you can see around you,
 and allow you to give commands which will control your character. For
 example, to see what the player "Larry" looks like, type "look Larry". To
 get Larry's condom, type "grab Larrys's condom". To move west, type
 "go west", "west", or simply "w". To get more detailed help on any of the
 following type:
 
   Help Arouse.... How to Arouse Another Player
   Help Bank...... How to use the Bank
   Help Casino.... Using the Casino

 INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION
 
 Simply unzip the Erotica! game archive to your BBS server directory,
 add Erotica! to your menu, configure the MSG file to your liking, and start
 the BBS!  It's that easy! 
 
 We do, however, recommend setting the access key in the MSG file, and making
 sure that only adult users gain that key.  This is not a "family" game. There
 are two options in LEVEL4 - to show a logon message and the rate at which
 the game disperses new items. Most configuration is text blocks in LEVEL6!
